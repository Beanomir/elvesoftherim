This mod doesn't have any extra requirements besides owning the required DLC's. There are plenty of other fantasy elf mods that are much more extensive then what I've made. I wanted to create something that just used the systems the game provides to add some personal flair to world generation, with the intent of keeping it somewhat lore friendly.
